In that project I used Django Rest Framework. Prepared requirenments.txt file

Endpoints:
/download - endpoint to download data from API/json file and store it in database
/photo - endpoint to list photo data from local database (decreased amount of items because app worked slowly with 5000 items)
/delete/pk - endpoint to delete concrete item from local database
/update/pk  - endpoint to update photo data from local database
/add - endpoint to add photo data from local database
